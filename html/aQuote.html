        	"People have this vision of being the CEO of a company they started and being on top     of the pyramid. Some people are motivated by that, but that's not at all what it's     like.
            </p>
            <p>
            What it's really like: everyone else is your boss â€“ all of your employees, customers, partners, users, media are your boss. I've never had more bosses and needed to account for more people today.
    	    </p>
            <p>
        The life of      most CEOs is reporting to everyone else, at least that's what it feels like to me and mos     t CEOs I know. If you want to exercise power and authority over      people, join the military or go into politics. Don't be an entrepreneur."
